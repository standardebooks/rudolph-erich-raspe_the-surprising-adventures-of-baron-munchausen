				<h3 epub:type="title">To the Public</h3>
				<p>Having heard, for the first time, that my adventures have been doubted, and looked upon as jokes, I feel bound to come forward and vindicate my character <em>for veracity</em>, by paying three shillings at the Mansion House of this great city for the affidavits hereto appended.</p>
				<p>This I have been forced into in regard of my own honour, although I have retired for many years from public and private life; and I hope that this, my last edition, will place me in a proper light with my readers.</p>
